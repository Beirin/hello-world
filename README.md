# hello-world
Newbie here! Hello world!
I've been around developers and designers all my working life and knew how to speak to them
but I have never taken the opportunity to sit down and learn how to program
At the age of 34(35 now) my twin boys were born and I wanted to explore opportunities to better my career
I currently work as a network administrator for a small company and do most of the IT support
It's a great job, good company, good people, but I don't get paid nearly enough to support my new family
So here I go
